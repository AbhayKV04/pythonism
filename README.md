# Pythonism
The Python I like.

### Hangman
Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses. [More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game))

*This is my implementation of (the functions of) the game in Python. Template provided by MIT (6.00.1x).*

### Tower of Hanoi
The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower and sometimes pluralized) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three sticks and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any stick. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one stick, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape. [More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)

*Short, simple yet beautiful and elegant solution of Tower of Hanoi in Python. Uses a recursive algorithm. So easy to understand, doesn't even need comments.
3 Sticks + Any Number of Discs = This Thing Works!*
